Shifting vector and virtual obstacle are proposed to derive the center of repulsive field which makes the robot move away from the obstacle: The shifting vector is derived from the velocity vector of the robot and the obstacle and the virtual obstacle is made by adding the shifting vector to the real obstacle. By considering the velocity vector of an obstacle with a shifting vector and a virtual obstacle, the robot can avoid not only stationary obstacles but also dynamic obstacles, where the fields are optimized by evolutionary programming. The performance of proposed method is demonstrated by simulations and experiments in robot soccer system.}

Based on the author's understanding of the reading materials, this paper summarizes the history of the robot architecture development, analyzes the problems and solutions encountered in the past, lays the foundation for the understanding of the architecture.

  abstract = {In this paper, we extend behavior trees (BTs), a behavior creation method that is popular in the video game industry, with three new types of nodes that facilitate the design and implementation of non-player characters (NPCs) that need to coordinate with each other. We provide an implementation and a methodology to use the coordination nodes of our extension appropriately, and we show how to use them to develop an application scenario. In the last years, coordination in multi-agent systems has been a very active research field, both from theoretical and practical points of view. Something similar has happened with the development of new tools for the video game industry. Our approach contributes to both areas by providing a novel extension that facilitates the design and implementation of agents that need to coordinate with each other. In video games, agents or NPCs are—as their name implies—characters that are not controlled by the player but by the game through an algorithmic, predetermined, or responsive behavior, or a more sophisticated AI technique. Some video games require NPCs with dynamic, credible, and intelligently unpredictable behaviors to keep players engaged and immersed. Instead of endowing NPCs with very complex individual behaviors, a feasible way to improve their unpredictability in an intelligent and credible manner is allowing them to coordinate with each other. Since BTs focus on the creation of individual behaviors, coordinated behaviors nowadays tend to be achieved by hard-coding the coordination itself. However, that ad hoc solution partially drives away some of the benefits that popularized BTs: Being visually intuitive, scalable, and reusable. For this reason, we propose an extension to BTs that developers can use to coordinate NPCs without going against the development paradigm: creating complex behaviors by designing an intuitive tree structure.}

  abstract = {Behavior Trees (BTs) were invented as a tool to enable modular AI in computer games, but have received an increasing amount of attention in the robotics community in the last decade. With rising demands on agent AI complexity, game programmers found that the Finite State Machines (FSM) that they used scaled poorly and were difficult to extend, adapt and reuse. In BTs, the state transition logic is not dispersed across the individual states, but organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with the states as leaves. This has a significant effect on modularity, which in turn simplifies both synthesis and analysis by humans and algorithms alike. These advantages are needed not only in game AI design, but also in robotics, as is evident from the research being done. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of the topic of BTs in Artificial Intelligence and Robotic applications. The existing literature is described and categorized based on methods, application areas and contributions, and the paper is concluded with a list of open research challenges.}

On the one hand, there is qualitative scaling, meaning that (social) complexity is increased, introducing regular practices of action, institutions, new fields of social action and requiring new dimensions in perception and decision making. On the other hand, researchers are interested in investigating quantitative scalability, i.e. how goals can be achieved under the constraints imposed by a growing population.Our argument is structured as follows: firstly, we want to establish that organizations and interorganizational networks are an important cornerstone for the analysis of qualitative scaling. Secondly, we show by empirical evaluation that an elaborate theoretical concept of such networks increases the quantitative scalability of multiagent systems.},
