\begin{abstract}
    In the academic world, university robotics competitions play a major role in developing the field's scenario both nationally and internationally, encouraging research and design of robotic systems. In the context of these competitions, one of the most challenging and stimulating robot categories is the \textit{IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS)}, which aims to develop a complete engineering solution for a team of robots that play soccer autonomously. The ThundeRatz Robotics Team at the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo currently has a solution for the problem proposed by the category, which uses the \textit{Robotic Operating System (ROS)} for structuring the system, behavior trees for modeling the intelligent agents that play soccer and a Finite State Machine to coordinate these agents. This solution is known as the ThunderVolt team and is the target of this work, which aims to improve the team by developing a new coordination strategy using behavior trees, based on a team organization model made using \MOISEp. Furthermore, the performance of the improvement was compared to the previous system that used a Finite State Machine, and was tested in an academic robotics competition, the results of both evaluations will be discussed.
