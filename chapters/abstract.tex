\def \MOISEp {$\mathcal{M}OISE^+$} 

In the academic world, university robotics competitions play a major role in developing the field of robotics both nationally and internationally, encouraging research and design of robotic systems. In the context of these competitions, one of the most challenging and stimulating robot categories is the \textit{IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS)}, which aims to develop a complete engineering solution for a team of robots that play soccer autonomously. The ThundeRatz Robotics Team at at the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo currently has a solution to the problem proposed by the category, which uses the \textit{Robotic Operating System (ROS)} to structure the system and behavior trees for modeling of intelligent agents who play soccer. This solution is known as the ThunderVolt team and will be the target of this work, which aims to improve the team by developing a specification of an organization of a multi-agent system based on the \MOISEp specification, using behavior trees. This organization will allow the elaboration of a team coordination strategy based on the technologies already used and validating these enhancements in an academic competition, the \textit{IRONCup 2023} \footnote{https://events.robocore.net/ironcup-2023/}.
